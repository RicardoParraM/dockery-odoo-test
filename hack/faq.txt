Q: How to add a dependency once everything is already build:

A: Using https://github.com/OCA/web.git as an example, there are two options:

1) start again from "make init"

2) a) `git submodule add https://github.com/OCA/web.git vendor/OCA/web`
   b) Edit Dockerfile by adding after the line
   	  "## NOTE: later *modules* override their previous namesake"
   	  a new line with:
      `COPY --chown=odoo:odoo vendor/OCA/web/* /opt/odoo/addons/011/`
   c) Edit docker-compose.override.yaml by placing after te line
      "# Put additional volumes here":
      `- ./vendor/OCA/web:/opt/odoo/addons/011:ro`
      Remove "{{ VOLUMES }}"" placeholder, if it should be still there.
   d) And finally do again: `docker-compose up odoo`
   e) Optionally, you also can rebuild the images, right now: `make build`
